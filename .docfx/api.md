# Result Cs

The two main classes that drive the functionality are:

- [`Option`](~/api/WicalWare.Components.ResultCs.Option-1.html)
- [`Result`](~/api/WicalWare.Components.ResultCs.Result-2.html)

The expectation of the consumer in using the functionality is that they respect that all inputs and outputs are _forbidden_ from being `null`.
